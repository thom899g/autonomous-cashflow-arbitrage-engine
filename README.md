# autonomous-cashflow-arbitrage-engine
This project will develop an AI-driven engine that identifies and executes arbitrage opportunities across multiple cryptocurrency exchanges, leveraging real-time price data to generate passive income. The system will use Python libraries like ccxt for API access and implement machine learning models to predict optimal trading times.
